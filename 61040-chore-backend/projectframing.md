**Domain**  
Real time urban nightlife, location-based consumer information system

**Problem**  
People frequently want to go out but have no reliable signal about how long the line is, how crowded the venue is, or whether it’s even worth going compared to choosing an alternative. Also, venues have a hard time getting reliable real-time data about capacity and flow in their events, which makes it more difficult to manage and even less reliable for the customers.

**Evidence**  
People regularly complain about long lines at restaurants, bars, and clubs. People also spend time choosing where to go, depending on the amount of people at the event already. Venues are interested about how many people are waiting.

**Comparables**

1) Google's ‘Popular Times’ Tab \- When you search up restaurants on Google, many have the option for you to see how busy it is according to the location history of users at the establishment. There are accuracy issues because it only counts those who have their location history enabled. Additionally, this feature misses a lot of information that a single user or venue could provide. Such as active events, exact wait times, what sports events are being shown, and general atmosphere  
2) BarGlance app shows real time vibe measurements and crowd indicators, but does not offer venue side operations, predictive analytics

**Features**

1) User reported wait times and real time feed of updates, crowd density and vibe level  
2) Venue profiles with location, hours, peak times, events, and wait stats  
3) Filtering venues by events   
4) Push alerts for when wait times increase or decrease   
5) Heat maps of areas with high activity  
6) Predicted “peak” forecast based on patterns from previous data

**Ethical analysis**  
Stakeholders:

1) Observation: Users often seek specific events at venues that can be difficult to discover online, such as trivia nights, live music, or certain sports games. Venues, in turn, aim to publicize these events to a broader audience beyond their regular patrons.  
2) Design: Enabling both venues and users to report current events provides a clearer picture of a location’s atmosphere. User-submitted reports help fill gaps where venues do not publicize events online, making it easier for users to discover and attend these activities.

Time: 

1) Observation: Individuals using this application to minimize wait times for typically lengthy tasks (i.e., DMV, pharmacy) would likely want to be alerted when wait times are low.  
2) Design: Allowing users to set alerts for specific locations will help them take advantage of shorter wait times without needing to check constantly.

Pervasiveness: Accounting for Culture \- How might your app be misunderstood by users who are unfamiliar with your culture?

1) Observation: The check-in and real-time reporting feature could be seen as intrusive in cultures valuing personal privacy. Users may avoid contributing, reducing app effectiveness.  
2) Design: Allow fully anonymous or opt-in contributions and offer the ability to blur location or generalize to neighborhoods rather than exact spots.

Values: Deliberate on and then designate three primary values you app ideally would support.

1) Observation: Privacy, community, and informed decision making. The app is designed to protect privacy, foster community engagement, and empower users to make informed decisions.  
2) Design: Users can contribute anonymously or with blurring of location data to maintain privacy. Reputation systems, real-time feeds, and coordination features strengthen community participation. Live wait times, crowd indicators, hype scores, allow users to easily make choices.
