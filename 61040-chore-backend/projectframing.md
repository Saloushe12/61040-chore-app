# Domain
Household management and productivity, improving coordination in shared living spaces.

# Problem
Coming up with a fair system to distribute chores between a group of individuals such that everyone generally does the same amount of work while ensuring chores also get completed. 

# Evidence
 In our (Dylan and Stephen’s) living group, we are each obligated to do a certain amount of chores per semester. Our current system is to use a google spreadsheet, but this does not resolve load balancing issue (e.g. someone frontloading all their chores) or provide an easy way to verify chores are done. More generally, anyone not living alone would benefit from having an easy way to track chore completion.

# Comparables: 
Tody is an app which offers chore tracking but focuses on gamification of doing chores, rather than dividing chores between people. 
Flatastic is an app which targets shared living, but its chore function is limited and doesn’t integrate with scheduling or accountability features.
Google Sheets can be used for chore tracking, but doesn’t allow for automation and reminders. 
Pen and paper - Many living groups use pen and paper for chore tracking, however this method takes time and effort along with being an ineffective way for people to know what their weekly responsibilities are. Additionally this method has a high probability for human error and unfairness. 

# Features:
Tasks: Chores can be input, with their name, description, relative difficulty, frequency, and due date

User fairness: Users during a certain time period at the beginning of the week can claim chores, each chore they claim gives them a certain number of points based on relative difficulty. Users are maxed out a certain amount of points based on total points of all the chores and number of users. 

Automated assignment: After the time period at the beginning of the week, the unclaimed chores are assigned to users. The assignment of what chores go to what people is based on who is the furthest way from the point maximum

Chore tracking: When a user completes the chore they can log it in the app so other users can see what chores have and have not been completed

# Ethical Analysis


## Time - Adaptation: What is a lifestyle change that your app may support? Does it inhibit any positive lifestyle changes, or encourage negative ones? 
Observation: The app is designed to offer users greater control than their existing chore system. The app may improve users’ lifestyles by making them complete an appropriate amount of chores, which makes their shared living space more habitable, and also aid users with gaining discipline and responsibility.

Design: We could add widgets/notifications that vary based on a user’s performance. Users not performing up to par could get a sad notification with a red background saying “try harder”, and users overperforming could get a happy green notification saying “you did great!”


## Stakeholders - Direct stakeholders : In what key roles will individuals interact directly with your app?
Observation : The direct stakeholders of this app are those who live in a group where chores need to be assigned and completed individually. These direct stakeholders would likely be using the app to ensure fairness within task assignment. For that reason such individuals might not only care about the workload for the current week, but the overall workload of individuals over multiple weeks. 

Design : The app could keep track of all of the users total points they gathered over the entire semester. When assigning tasks at the beginning of the week, the app could not only take into account the users that week who signed up for the least amount, but also how many points each of those users have from the entire semester.


## Pervasiveness - Accounting for Culture - How might your app be misunderstood by users who are unfamiliar with your culture?
Observation: In some cultures, gender roles strongly influence task division, which may affect how users perceive fairness. The app’s assumption of equal participation conflicts with traditional norms or family hierarchies.

Design: Instead of assuming all users share chores equally, the app will have different options for adjustable fairness settings. This allows households to define who is responsible for which type of tasks according to their own cultural or personal norms.


## Values  - Choose Your Values - Designate three primary values your app would ideally support
Observation: Some important values: fairness, self-efficacy, community. The chores app is designed so that each user completes their fair share of chores. The app promotes/encourages users to do their chores, an expected responsibility when living in a group. The app promotes doing chores, which strengthens the living group’s sense of community

Design: The app’s visual design could include artworks that demonstrate the importance of community, fairness, and self-efficacy. The app could contain stat trackers that show the user how much they have done and how much the entire group has done.


## Time - Long Term Health and Wellbeing - 3 to 5 ways your app influences health and well-being years after use
Observation: The app is designed to encourage individual responsibility, a clean living area, and community effort. Using the app daily will ensure the user is responsible, motivated, and helps their community.

Design: The app could have a stat tracker that tracks how many days the user has done their chore. There could even be a “streak” system like snapchat where users that do their chores daily get longer and longer streaks.
